  "fullDescription": "This portfolio website serves as a living, data-driven profile that automatically updates its content from external platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, the architecture emphasizes modularity and decoupling — every project, experience, and metric is fetched dynamically through APIs rather than being hardcoded. The frontend remains lightweight and reactive, adapting to real-time data changes while maintaining consistent visual identity and performance. The site integrates with Vercel for deployment and GitHub for live project synchronization, enabling a hands-free, self-updating showcase of ongoing development work.",
